This unpacked extension will listen for various requests to Twitter.com URLs and will replace them Tweetbot-compatible ones instead.

There's not much here yet, but if you want to contribute, just create a pull request, and I'll probably accept it if it fixes an issue or adds some cool new functionality.

Enjoy!
