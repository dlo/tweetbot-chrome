### tweetbot-chrome

This unpacked extension will listen for various requests to Twitter.com URLs and will replace them Tweetbot-compatible ones instead.

There's not much here yet, but if you want to contribute, just create a pull request, and I'll probably accept it if it fixes an issue or adds some cool new functionality.

Enjoy!

### Installation

Will try to improve this soon, but for now...

1. Download and unzip the project.
2. Open the extension manager for Chrome and click "Load unpacked extension".
3. Select the folder which you unzipped Tweetbot Linker.
4. All done!
